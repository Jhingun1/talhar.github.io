        <h2> Backstory </h2>
        <p> I was born at a very young age. </p>
        <br>

        <h2> Current Plight  </h2>
        <p> I'm an undergraduate student at Hunter College, majoring in Computer Science, 
            because I enjoy trying to figure out
            why my programs refuse to compile.
        </p>
        <p> You can check out what I am currently trying to debug on my <a href="https://www.github.com/TalhaR">GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p> I'm also in the middle of making this website a bit better. </p>
        <br>

        <h2> Projects </h2>
        <h4> Calculator</h4>
        <img src="img/calc.png" alt="My Calculator in Action" style="">
        <p>I wrote this calculator application in Java. The GUI was made with JavaFX. 
        I made this because everything I did for my class was command line-based.
        So, I decided to learn on my own how to make a GUI. This won't be replacing 
        the windows calculator anytime soon, but we're getting there.</p>
