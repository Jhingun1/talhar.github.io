        <h1> About Me </h1>

        <h2> Backstory </h2>
        <p> I was born at a very young age. </p>
        <br>

        <h2> Current Plight  </h2>
        <p> I'm an undergraduate student at Hunter College, majoring in Computer Science, 
            because I enjoy trying to figure out
            why my programs refuse to compile.
        </p>
        <p> You can check out what I am currently trying to debug on my <a href="https://www.github.com/TalhaR">GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p> I'm also in the middle of making this website a bit better. </p>
        <br>

        <h2> Projects </h2>
        <h4> Calculator</h4>
        <img src="img/calc.png" width = "200" height = "350">
        <p> I wrote this calculator application in Java. The GUI was made with JavaFX. </p>
        <p> I made this because everything I did for my class was command line-based.
        <br> So I decided to learn on my own how to make a GUI. This won't be replacing<br> 
        the windows calculator anytime soon, but hey we're getting there.</p>
